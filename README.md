- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Headless-Rasputin. I'm headless because I first started learning about programming through my raspberry pi but since I didn't have a functional monitor, I began learning with SSH in a headless state. Rasputin because of the (rasp)berry pi and my affinity for all things Russian. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Bitcoin the protocol, bitcoin the currency, Linux, open-source software, and web development.
